# oph3z-look

##Information:
The script is very simple. The logic is that if there are no other players in the direction my character is facing, their opacity goes down, but if there are other players in the direction my character is facing, i see normal. It helps players in these roles. Here, if the opacity of that player is low, he knows that he does not see that person in the role. It is a very simple project made on special request.
